        <h1>Expanding HL7 FHIR to Support Chronic Disease Registries</h1>
        <p>This project develops a regulatory-compliant implementation of the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a>) standard, enabling incorporation of clinical research data from a wide variety of sources, including patient-reported outcomes (PROs).</p>

              <p class="lead">Under the auspices of a collaborative project grant from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/RiRuGVWoAEuPn5nyxUQ8DA/project-details/9720434"><i>Expanding HL7 FHIR to support post-marketing research and surveillance within multi-source, chronic disease registries</i></a>), the Registries + Informatics R&#38;D Group at Boston Children's Hospital has developed and implemented a new FHIR Implementation Guide that focuses on:
              <ul class="larger-ul">
                <li>Incorporating data from various clinical research sources, including patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data, into 21 CFR Part 11 compliant workflows using FHIR</li>
                <li>Implementing a standardized approach within FHIR to query and validate auditable, reproducible data warehousing and interchange to support 21 CFR Part 11 compliant analyses for all phases of clinical research</li>
